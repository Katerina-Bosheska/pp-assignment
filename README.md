The application runs on http://localhost:8080.<br/>
I used H2 database, the necessary configuration for accessing the database can be found in application.properties.<br/>
The GraphQL queries are directed at the http://localhost:8080/rest endpoint while the other endpoints can be seen in the BooksController class.
